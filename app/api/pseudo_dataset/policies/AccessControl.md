# Boogle Inc. Access Control Policy
Policy Number: IT-SEC-001 Effective Date: August 11, 2025 Last Reviewed: August 11, 2025 Policy Owner: Chief Technology Officer (CTO)
1.0 Purpose and Overview
This document outlines the Access Control Policy for Boogle Inc. The purpose of this policy is to establish the rules and requirements for granting, managing, and revoking access to Boogle Inc.'s information systems, data, and physical facilities. The primary goal is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our corporate and customer data by ensuring that access is granted on a "need-to-know" basis and based on the principle of least privilege. This policy is a critical component of our commitment to data security and operational integrity.
2.0 Scope
This policy applies to all Boogle Inc. employees (full-time, part-time, and temporary), contractors, consultants, vendors, and any other third parties who require access to Boogle Inc.'s information systems, networks, applications, data, or physical premises. This policy covers all company-owned or managed systems, including but not limited to servers, databases, cloud services (e.g., AWS, Salesforce), internal applications, and office facilities.
3.0 Policy Statements
3.1 Principle of Least Privilege
All access rights shall be granted based on the Principle of Least Privilege. This means that users will only be given the minimum level of access and permissions necessary to perform their explicitly assigned job duties. Access to sensitive information or critical systems beyond a user's role requirements is strictly prohibited.
3.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Access to Boogle Inc. systems shall be managed through a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model. Predefined roles with specific sets of permissions will be created based on job functions (e.g., "Sales Representative," "Software Engineer," "Finance Analyst"). Users will be assigned to roles that correspond to their job responsibilities. Any request for access not covered by a standard role must be formally justified and approved by the user's manager and the IT Department.
3.3 User Access Lifecycle Management
3.3.1 Onboarding:
Human Resources (HR) will notify the IT Department of all new hires at least five (5) business days prior to their start date.
The hiring manager must submit a formal access request specifying the required systems and roles for the new employee.
The IT Department will create user accounts and assign access rights based on the approved RBAC role before the employee's first day.
3.3.2 Transfers and Role Changes:
When an employee transfers to a new position or their job responsibilities change significantly, their manager must notify the IT Department.
A review of the user's access rights will be conducted. Previous access rights that are no longer required for the new role will be revoked, and new access will be granted as needed.
3.3.3 Offboarding:
HR and the employee's manager are responsible for immediately notifying the IT Department of any employee termination (voluntary or involuntary).
All of the user's access to Boogle Inc. systems, applications, and networks will be revoked by the end of their last day of employment.
All physical access (e.g., keycards) must be returned to HR or the Facilities department on the employee's last day.
3.4 Authentication and Password Requirements
Unique User IDs: All users must be assigned a unique User ID. Sharing of user accounts or credentials is strictly forbidden.
Password Complexity: All passwords must meet a minimum complexity requirement: at least 12 characters, including an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, a number, and a special character.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): MFA is required for access to all critical systems, including cloud services, VPN, and financial applications.
Password Changes: Users are required to change their passwords every 90 days.
3.5 Access Reviews
The IT Department, in conjunction with department managers, will conduct quarterly access reviews for all employees.
These reviews will verify that current access levels are still appropriate for each user's job function.
An annual review of access to highly sensitive systems (e.g., production databases, customer data repositories) will be conducted. All findings and remediations must be documented.
3.6 Remote Access
All remote access to Boogle Inc.'s internal network must be conducted through the company-approved Virtual Private Network (VPN).
Split-tunneling on the VPN is prohibited to ensure all traffic is routed through company security controls.
Devices used for remote access must comply with Boogle Inc.'s security standards, including having up-to-date antivirus software and operating system patches.
3.7 Third-Party and Vendor Access
Access for third parties (contractors, vendors) must be sponsored by a Boogle Inc. manager, be time-limited, and restricted to only the systems necessary for their specific engagement.
All third parties must sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) before being granted any system access.
Third-party accounts will be automatically disabled upon contract expiration.
3.8 Physical Access Control
Access to Boogle Inc. office facilities is controlled via an electronic keycard system.
Employees are prohibited from holding doors open for or granting access to individuals they do not recognize. All visitors must be signed in at the front desk.
Access to sensitive areas, such as server rooms, is restricted to authorized IT personnel only.
4.0 Roles and Responsibilities
Employees: Responsible for protecting their assigned credentials, reporting any suspected security incidents, and adhering to this policy.
Managers: Responsible for defining access requirements for their team members, approving access requests, and participating in regular access reviews.
IT Department: Responsible for implementing, managing, and monitoring access control systems, processing access requests, and conducting security reviews.
Human Resources (HR): Responsible for managing the employee lifecycle process and promptly communicating hiring and termination information to the IT Department.
Policy Owner (CTO): Responsible for the overall maintenance and enforcement of this policy.
5.0 Enforcement
Any violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, in accordance with Boogle Inc.'s employee handbook and applicable laws. Unauthorized access or disclosure of company or customer data may also lead to legal action.
6.0 Policy Review and Maintenance
This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur in business operations, technology, or the threat landscape.
