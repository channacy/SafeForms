Boogle Inc. Encryption Standards Policy
Policy Number: IT-SEC-002 Effective Date: August 11, 2025 Last Reviewed: August 11, 2025 Policy Owner: Chief Technology Officer (CTO)
1.0 Purpose and Overview
This document defines the minimum standards for the use of encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of Boogle Inc.'s corporate and customer data. This policy ensures that sensitive information is rendered unreadable and unusable to unauthorized individuals, both when it is stored (data-at-rest) and when it is being transmitted across networks (data-in-transit). This policy is a supplement to the Access Control Policy (IT-SEC-001).
2.0 Scope
This policy applies to all Boogle Inc. systems, applications, databases, and devices that store or transmit company or customer data. This includes, but is not limited to, servers, employee workstations (laptops and desktops), mobile devices, network communications, and data stored with third-party cloud service providers. All employees, contractors, and vendors are required to adhere to these standards.
3.0 Policy Statements
3.1 Data-in-Transit Encryption
Network Communications: All data transmitted over public or untrusted networks (e.g., the internet) must be encrypted using strong, industry-standard protocols.
Standard: Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.2 or higher is required. TLS 1.3 is the preferred standard. Outdated protocols such as SSLv2, SSLv3, and TLS 1.0/1.1 are explicitly forbidden.
Internal Network Traffic: Encryption of sensitive data transmitted within the internal corporate network is required where technically feasible, especially between different security zones (e.g., between application servers and database servers).
Remote Access: All VPN connections must utilize strong encryption algorithms, such as AES-256.
Wireless Networks: All corporate wireless networks must be secured using WPA2 or WPA3 with a strong, complex passphrase.
3.2 Data-at-Rest Encryption
Servers and Databases: All servers and databases storing sensitive information, particularly customer data, financial records, or intellectual property, must utilize full-disk or database-level encryption.
Standard: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a key length of 256 bits (AES-256) is the required minimum standard for symmetric encryption.
Employee Endpoints: All company-issued laptops and mobile devices must have full-disk encryption enabled (e.g., BitLocker for Windows, FileVault for macOS).
Removable Media: Any removable media (e.g., USB drives, external hard drives) used to store or transport sensitive company data must be encrypted. The use of unencrypted removable media for sensitive data is prohibited.
Cloud Storage: All data stored with third-party cloud providers must be encrypted at rest using provider-managed or customer-managed keys, conforming to the AES-256 standard.
3.3 Cryptographic Key Management
Key Generation: Cryptographic keys must be generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator.
Key Storage and Protection: Keys must be stored securely with strict access controls. Access to cryptographic keys should be limited to the smallest possible number of authorized personnel and automated processes. Keys should never be stored in plaintext alongside the data they protect.
Key Rotation: Cryptographic keys used for data encryption should be rotated at least annually or more frequently if there is a suspected compromise.
Key Destruction: When a cryptographic key is retired, it must be securely destroyed in a manner that makes it irrecoverable.
4.0 Roles and Responsibilities
Employees: Responsible for ensuring that devices under their control comply with this policy (e.g., not disabling full-disk encryption) and for using approved methods for data transfer.
IT Department / Security Team: Responsible for implementing, managing, and monitoring encryption technologies across the organization, managing the key lifecycle, and ensuring compliance with these standards.
Application Developers: Responsible for incorporating approved encryption protocols and libraries into the applications they build.
Policy Owner (CTO): Responsible for the overall strategy, maintenance, and enforcement of this policy.
5.0 Enforcement
Non-compliance with this Encryption Standards Policy will be treated as a security violation. Any identified deviation from this policy must be reported to the IT Department. Violations may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, and may expose the individual and the company to legal and financial risk.
6.0 Policy Review and Maintenance
This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually to reflect changes in cryptographic best practices, the technology landscape, and regulatory requirements.
